	<b>Description:</b> n cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a slip cordon or the slips) is placed behind the batter on the off side of the field. The slip cordon distance from the batter increases with the pace of the bowler; generally they will be marginally further away from the batter than the wicket-keeper is.<br><br><br><br>

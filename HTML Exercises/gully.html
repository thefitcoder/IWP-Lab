	<h2>Gully</h2>
	<b>Description:</b> The gully is just behind square of the wicket on the off side. Quick reactions is key to this position. Most chances that come in this area will be from forceful shots from the batsman that haven't been kept down. The ball is likely to be travelling very quickly so anyone fielding here has to be on their toes.<br><br><br><br>
	<b>Favourite Filder:</b> Ravindra Jadeja
